        <h1 class="h1">About this project</h1>
        <p>This project is intended to explore the catechism in a digital way. I plan on using tei
            to analyze the text. The tei catechism was inspired by both Fr. Mike Schmitz catechism
            in a year and St. Carlo Acutis. This project is independent of any university or
            organization.</p>
